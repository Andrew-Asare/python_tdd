# TDD Test Driven Development
## Why should we use TDD
### What are the benefits of using TDD

**Best Use Cases** 
- We will use pytest unittest in python to implement TDD
- TDD is widely used and is the cheapest way to test the code or implement test driven development

**Best practices for TDD**

- Write the smallest possible test case that matches what we need to program
- TDD cycle starts with everything failing -`Red`
- Write code to pass the test - `Green`
- Refactor the code for next test - `Blue`
- This continues until all the tests have successfully passed
